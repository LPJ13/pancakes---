We love simple, no-fail recipes and this pancake recipe is just that. It’s quick to make, and we’re willing to bet you’ve got everything you need to make them right now. Here’s a quick breakdown of what you will need (the full recipe with ingredient amounts is shared in the recipe below):

Flour: Use all-purpose flour or whole wheat. A combination of the both is nice, too. For pancakes without all-purpose flour, use your favorite gluten-free flour blend or try buckwheat flour (here is our buckwheat pancake recipe for you to take a look at).
Sugar: We use granulated sugar, but you could experiment with brown sugar. Brown sugar will make them a little moister.

Baking Powder: Baking powder makes them light and fluffy. If you’d like to make pancakes without baking powder, I’ve shared tips in the frequently asked questions below.

Salt: We like to use 3/4 teaspoon of coarse salt (or 1/2 teaspoon of fine salt). It balances the sugar nicely and brings out lots of flavor in the pancakes. If you are using salted butter, you may want to reduce this.

Milk: We usually stick to reduced-fat milk, since that’s what we have in the fridge, but whole milk or skim milk will work, too. For pancakes without dairy milk, substitute non-dairy milk (like unsweetened almond milk or homemade oat milk). I’ve also used orange juice in place of the milk before and it worked nicely. For buttermilk pancakes, take a look at our Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes recipe.

Melted Butter: You can’t beat the taste of butter for this, but we’ve found that melted coconut oil is delicious. We use unsalted butter, but salted butter will work as a substitute. If you do use salted butter, you might want to reduce the amount of salt called for in the recipe below. For pancakes without butter, substitute melted coconut oil.

One Egg: The egg adds structure and helps with how light and fluffy they become. I’ve shared tips in the frequently asked questions below for making pancakes without egg. We use a flax egg. (You might also enjoy our recipe for vegan pancakes)

Vanilla Extract: Vanilla adds sweetness and depth of flavor. You could try other extracts, too. Almond extract would be pretty delicious.
