variations

 Add what you love. Here are a few suggestions:

Sprinkle a handful of berries, nuts or chocolate chips into the batter. (We love adding fresh blueberries or mashed and sliced banana)
Layer a few thin slices of strawberry or banana onto the wet batter once added to the skillet. Then, flip. (We added a banana to these spiced, buttermilk and banana pancakes)
Add lemon zest or spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg or allspice (see our cinnamon-spiced fluffy pancakes with a cinnamon roll glaze)
Try replacing some of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour (see our easy fluffy whole wheat pancakes).
Add a few spoonfuls of flax seeds, oats, or reduce the sugar.
